/*
 This routine is used to remove a course session.
 The inputs to the routine include the following:
    course offering identifier
    session number

If the course session has not yet started and the request is valid,
    the routine will process the request with the necessary updates.
The request must not be performed if there is at least one registration for the session.

Note that the resultant seating capacity of the course offering
    could fall below the course offeringâ€™s target number of registrations, which is allowed.
